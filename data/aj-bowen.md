Experience
----------
 
**Technical community manager, Gandi.net**

Job responsibilities included:

* **evangelism**: online and in person (at tech conferences and industry events), help existing and prospective
  customers to make the most of Gandi's products (domain names, SSL certs, hosting, and the corresponding APIs);
* **social media**: managing Gandi's presence (initially a French brand) on US and English-speaking channels;
* **localization**: technical and marketing communications (product releases, newsletters, announcement, outages);
* **hiring**: as one of our first US hires, I helped build a team (now 15 people) that is to become the company's
  center of gravity
* **documentation**:
* **special projects**:

Interact with various tech communities, online and at industry events, letting developers know we exist, 
helping them make the most of Gandi's domain, SSL and hosting APIs, and communicating their feedback 
to our technical team. Internally, I work with engineers, product managers and support to improve Gandi's 
APIs, web interface, documentation and open source presence.

Help shape Gandi's voice our blog posts, newsletters and social media interactions, organize events
and manage our supported projects.

* Cultivated a [thriving and enthusiastic community](https://twitter.com/gandibar/favorites). 
 
**Support representative, Gandi.net**

My original role at Gandi was entry-level support: troubleshooting and explaining issues relating to domain names, DNS, SSL certificates and basic hosting. My curiosity and interest in this role led me to specialize in more technical hosting issues, while helping to hire, train and mentor new employees. My French language and community-related skills led me to move to San Francisco to take on an official evangelism rolein 2013.

**Previous positions**

* Teacher and tutor
* Federal Student Aid specialist
* Office manager

Technical Experience and other skills
--------------------
 
My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.
 
    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.
 
Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...
 
Programming Languages and technologies
:   I like to automate things.

    * **Python:** Contributions to the [Gandi CLI](cli.gandi.net).
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.
 
    * **Shell scripting:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 
 
    * **Docker:** Provided hosting infrasructure and helped administer Docker workshops for hundreds of people at mutiple tech conferences. 

    * Basic knowledge of **C**, **C++*, **Javascript**

Research
:   I have a fondness for solving mysteries, which has manifested itself
    in a passion for genealogy, private investigations and legal research.

Activism
:   I became involved in activism in 2012 thanks to the Occupy movement, which appealed to me due to its horizontal nature. It was there where I learned how to organize without leaders, handle delicate media situations gracefully, encrypt my communications, create partnerships with unexpected allies, and create maximum impact with limited resources.
