I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

My ideal roles involve some combination of the following:

  - writing useful tools (libraries, CLIs) that improve efficiency,
  - playing with APIs, connecting services, making mashups and integrations,
  - automating all the things,
  - documenting all the things,
  - making the world better, one way or another

Right now some of the more abstract tools* I'm equipped with are:

  - an incorrigible curiosity,
  - a sort of fierce empathy,
  - an incorruptible rage at injustice,
  - a relentless stubborn determination when faced with a problem or a mystery,
  - an obsession with well-made things and awesome documentation,
  - an endless supply of ideas and hypotheses,
  - a tiny bit of a bunch of other things, due to the aforementioned curiosity,
  - an apparent intuition for seeing causal relationships in the "big picture"


\* several of these qualities have gotten me into trouble at some point, so YMMV.

- containerized numerous microservices\n

Gandi's APIs, web interface, documentation and open source presence based
on feedback collected from the community.

I shaped much of Gandi's voice via blog posts, newsletters and social media
interactions. I created, edited and localized a wide variety of technical
documentation, emergency communications and product communications.

I guided and managed Gandi's supported initiatives and open source projects,
organizing various campaigns and partnerships for our mutual benefit.

I tested and documented a huge number of Gandi's products and features.

Mostly: I was ready for anything, which usually happened at least twice a
week.\n\n
